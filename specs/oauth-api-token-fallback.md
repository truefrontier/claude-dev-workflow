# OAuth-to-API Token Fallback System Specification

**Feature:** OAuth-to-API Token Fallback
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-09-28
**Status:** Ready for Development

## Executive Summary

This specification defines an intelligent authentication fallback system for Claude workflows that uses OAuth tokens (Pro/Max subscription) by default, with automatic fallback to API tokens when OAuth limits are exceeded. The system preserves workflow state and resumes execution seamlessly, optimizing costs while maintaining reliability.

## User Description

Users with Claude Pro/Max subscriptions want to maximize the value of their subscription by using their included usage limits for GitHub workflow automation. When those limits are exceeded, the system should automatically fall back to API token billing without interrupting the workflow or losing progress.

## Primary User Story

As a Claude Pro/Max subscriber using GitHub workflows, I want to use my subscription's included usage limits first, so that I can minimize additional API costs while ensuring my workflows complete successfully even when I hit subscription limits.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Normal OAuth Success**
**Given** a user has valid OAuth token and available subscription limits
**When** a workflow is triggered requiring Claude execution
**Then** the workflow executes successfully using OAuth authentication
**And** no API token charges are incurred
**And** the workflow completes without fallback activation

**Scenario 2: OAuth Rate Limit with Successful Fallback**
**Given** a user's OAuth token hits subscription rate limits during execution
**When** the Claude action returns a 429 rate limit error
**Then** the fallback job automatically starts with API token
**And** execution resumes from the point of interruption
**And** the workflow completes successfully
**And** the user is notified which authentication method was used

**Scenario 3: Non-Rate-Limit OAuth Error**
**Given** an OAuth token encounters a non-rate-limit error (e.g., invalid token)
**When** the Claude action fails with authentication error
**Then** the fallback is NOT triggered
**And** the workflow fails with appropriate error message
**And** the user is directed to fix the OAuth configuration

**Scenario 4: API Token Fallback Failure**
**Given** OAuth fails due to rate limits AND API token is invalid/missing
**When** the fallback job attempts to use API token
**Then** the workflow fails with clear error message
**And** execution context is preserved for manual retry
**And** the user receives guidance on fixing token configuration

### Edge Cases

- **Scenario A: Mid-execution Rate Limit** - OAuth limit hit during large response generation
- **Scenario B: Multiple Concurrent Workflows** - Rate limits affecting multiple simultaneous executions
- **Scenario C: Token Refresh During Execution** - OAuth token expires and refreshes mid-workflow
- **Scenario D: Partial Response Scenarios** - Claude action partially completes before hitting limits

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Dual Authentication Support**
   - System MUST support both OAuth and API token authentication methods
   - OAuth tokens MUST be attempted first when available
   - API tokens MUST be used as fallback for rate limit scenarios only

2. **Error Detection and Classification**
   - System MUST detect Claude API rate limit errors (429, 529, token limits)
   - System MUST differentiate between rate limit and other error types
   - System MUST parse Claude API response headers for rate limit information

3. **State Preservation**
   - System MUST preserve workflow context before Claude execution
   - System MUST capture issue state, comments, and progress
   - System MUST prevent duplication of completed work

4. **Seamless Resumption**
   - Fallback job MUST resume from point of OAuth failure
   - System MUST maintain conversation context and history
   - Users MUST NOT need to manually intervene for fallback

5. **Transparent Operation**
   - Users MUST be notified which authentication method was used
   - Workflow logs MUST clearly indicate fallback activation
   - Cost implications MUST be communicated in workflow outputs

6. **Configuration Management**
   - System MUST support feature flag to enable/disable fallback
   - Both token types MUST be configurable via GitHub secrets
   - System MUST validate token availability before execution

### Key Entities

- **Authentication Manager**: Handles token selection and fallback logic
- **Error Classifier**: Analyzes Claude API responses and determines fallback necessity
- **State Preserver**: Captures and restores workflow execution context
- **Execution Coordinator**: Manages primary and fallback job orchestration

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Fallback activation MUST occur within 60 seconds of primary failure
- **Security**: All tokens MUST be stored as GitHub secrets, never logged or exposed
- **Usability**: Fallback operation MUST be transparent with clear status communication
- **Compatibility**: Solution MUST work with existing workflow patterns without breaking changes

## Technical Context

### Current Technology Stack
- **Platform**: GitHub Actions workflows (.yml files)
- **Authentication**: Currently uses `secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` only
- **Claude Integration**: `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`
- **Language**: YAML workflow syntax + bash scripting
- **State Management**: GitHub API, issue comments, workflow artifacts

### Performance Goals
- **Fallback Activation Time**: < 60 seconds from primary failure
- **State Preservation**: < 10 seconds to capture context
- **Resumption Time**: < 30 seconds to restore and continue

### Technical Constraints
- **GitHub Actions Limits**: 6-hour workflow timeout, artifact size limits
- **Token Security**: Must use GitHub secrets, no token exposure in logs
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing workflows must continue working

## Constitution Check

### Project Principles Alignment
- [x] **Simplicity**: Uses existing GitHub Actions patterns with minimal new complexity
- [x] **Architecture**: Extends current workflow pattern without fundamental changes
- [x] **Testing**: Includes comprehensive error scenario testing
- [x] **Observability**: Provides clear logging and status reporting
- [x] **Documentation**: Includes setup guides and troubleshooting

## Architecture Overview

The system implements a dual-job architecture within each stage workflow:

1. **Primary OAuth Job**: Attempts execution with OAuth token
2. **Error Detection**: Analyzes failure type and captures context
3. **Fallback API Job**: Executes with API token if OAuth rate limited
4. **State Management**: Preserves context between jobs using GitHub artifacts
